# ToDo:
# Still need to test with instanced geometry.  Especially the preferences like ignore hidden geometry.
#     And then tell this guy about it: https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/ltbbbc/
# Add some more robust checks to validate against nonmanifold geometry like more than 2 faces connected to 1 edge and such.  Some of the functions just assume that the correct components have been passed to them. (although that's not necessarily a bad thing; Blender internal does that a lot, too)
#     And--in appropriate places--tests like component.is_manifold, component.is_boundary, and (for edges only, I think) e.is_wire
# More speed/performance testing and improvements.
# Implement deselection for all methods of selection (except maybe select_linked).
#     This is actually going to be problematic because we need to track the most recent DEselected component, which Blender does not do.
#     This addon only executes on double click.  We would have to build a helper function to replace the regular view3d.select operator for deselecting with Ctrl+Click in order to make a persistent list of deselected components per object. (Unless we could have an always-running modal)
#     And Blender's wonky Undo system would invalidate the deselection list although that MAY not be a problem for something as simple as tracking only 2 components.
#     One of the the first things to find out is how blender handles the regular select history internally.
#     Because I need to know all of the operators that touch it.  For example if the select history has to coordinate the Delete operator.  When running a delete, does blender check if the selection that's being deleted is in the select history and purge it?  Or do they simply validate the things in the history later when needed by other operators?
#     Other things that could touch upon the history might include extrusions and bevels.  Basically anything that modifies topology or vertex order.
# Investigate doing our own raycasting. 
#     This would be needed if we want DEselection because Blender has no 'deselection history' list. Unless we want to compare the selection history for every view3d.select click but that would be much messier.
#     It is also a solution for the bug where double clicking on empty space causes a selection (although that one could alternatively be solved by adding 'deselect on nothing' to the default view3d.select keymap entries).
#     You can't raycast onto non-mesh objects.  Replacing view3d.select is a HUGE proposition that is significantly more complicated than what the add-on is already doing.  It might be easier to hack a deselection history into the C code even though I'm a novice.
# Find out if these selection tools can be made to work in the UV Editor. (NOTE: Probably need to set double click and shift double click operators for the UV section if the key map editor)
# Write own loop/ring selection function for wire edges.
#     After looking into this, this is actually much harder than I thought it would be.  Rings might be impossible, loops are HARD unless it's just a single loop (only 2 edges per vertex like the Circle object).  Will need extra steps and 2 or 3-level deep testing.
# Bounded edge loop selection on a floating edge ring like the Circle primitive type. (Wire edges.)
# Clean up kinda sloppy getting of prefs in some of the functions; not all are passing prefs around.
#     Or instead explore passing self instead of prefs.
# Possible new user preferences:
#     Double click on a boundary vertex triggers full_loop_vert_boundary instead of select_linked_pick.  This would be very easy to implement at the skip tests part of context_vert_select.  Maybe not quite as easy for the end of line but still doable.  The complexity goes inside get_bounded_selection.
#     Allow user to specify which select_linked method they want to use on double click? (from a dropdown list)  Or, instead maybe forcibly pop up the delimit=set() in the corner instead?  Hmm but it doesn't appear to always force the popup?
#     Preference to not use bm.select_flush_mode() at the end of the functions? This would make it so that sub-components aren't visibly selected (e.g. the edge between 2 verts) but you'd have to replace all the regular view3d.select operators as well.
# Consolidate redundant code.  I still haven't figured out a proper way to do this since the main loop-getting functions are almost identical but with different methods for getting the next component and testing for dead ends...
#     Partially done, now.  Made generic partial loop functions for manifold vertices, edges, and faces that are strung together to get full loops or bounded loops.
#     It simply may not be possible to consolidate further.
# Investigate if it's possible to remove or overwrite keymap entries that already exist (e.g. Blender's defaults) or if you can only add new ones.
#     This bug report suggests you maybe can't, but perhaps a timer could be used.  https://developer.blender.org/T78417
# Possible future upgrade for bounded selections using the "return single loop" preference: Return the loop whose end is closer to the mouse cursor.
#     This could be accomplished by running get_neighbour_x for the active component, 
#     then getting the /connecting/ component for each of those that attaches that component to active component,
#     then find which of those connecting components and/or neighbour components is closest to the cursor.  (In effect this replicates the old hated behavior of needing to click near the correct edge to get a proper ring selection but for this pref it might be tolerable)
#     As an example, say we're getting a bounded face loop.  If the preference is True AND there are multiple equal length loops,
#         Then we get the neighbour faces of the active face, and we get the edges of the active face.  
#         We find the active face edge that is closest to the cursor.
#         From the neighbour faces we find the face that has the act_face_edge as one of its edges
#         The loop we want is the one that contains that face.  It will be the only loop with a neighbour face that shares that one specific edge with the active_face

#         [X] Full loop
#         [X] Bounded loop
#
# A more radical option would be to get the bmesh and the active/previous_active component back in the main class and do bmesh.types.BMComponent sanity checks there to determine which context_N_select to use rather than relying on mesh_select_mode.
# That could possibly solve the Multi-select conundrum and we maybe wouldn't need to come up with logic to handle mesh_select_mode 1,0,0, 1,1,0, 1,0,1, 1,1,1, 0,1,0, 0,1,1, and 0,0,1 all individually.
# 
# Also if I get my bmesh back in the main class I could move the if len(bm.select_history) == 0: test up there as well.
#     Related to this, the main 3 context_N_select functions could actually return new_sel back to OBJECT_OT_context_select and let it do the actual selecting.
#     and then move that chunk at the bottom of all 3 with the select flush and the bmesh update_edit_mesh into OBJECT_OT_context_select as well to reduce code duplication.  Add a mode check so that we can handle the edge mode special case of clearing history and active edge.
# 
# Maybe the way to do it would be, if active and previous are the same type, use that appropriate context_N_select.  If they are different, return cancelled UNLESS the active is an edge, in which case, fire off context_edge_select with special logic 
# to skip all the tests and just select an edge loop (since it's a double click). I could restructure that function to use Modes (loop, ring, bounded?) perhaps.  Even if I don't this will be the most complicated function of the 3 just due to the many different edge types and selections.
# NOTE, HOWEVER, that if I allow the function to fire when the active and previous component are different types (e.g. a vert and an edge) there could possibly be conflicts with other add-ons like the issue that xan found when using PolyQuilt that I fixed.
