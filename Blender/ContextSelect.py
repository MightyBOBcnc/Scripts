# ToDo: 
# Write own select_linked function. :(  We must do so if we want to get rid of all uses of real deselection.  Say one object mesh has multiple detached pieces, each with only a partial selection, and we want to select_linked for only ONE of the pieces.
#     Blender's select_linked will run on ALL of the pieces that have a partial selection, not purely on the active component.
# Find out if there need to be any tests for hidden or instanced geometry when we're doing selections.
#    A quick test with the face loop and boundary loop selection near hidden faces didn't seem to show any issues.  (No hidden components are selected. It seems that hidden components cannot be selected in Blender.)  Still need to test with instanced geometry.
# See if it would be feasible to implement this idea as an optional addon preference: https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/ltbbbc/
#     HAH, not only is it feasible, this is actually how all of my bmesh code works by default... Crud...
#     So, I imagine the default user expectation is that selections should terminate if they encounter hidden components instead of continuing through them.  
#     So actually I need to implement a "hide" check for our normal selection (if v.hide, if e.hide, if f.hide) and then terminate selection and return early, or consider it a dead end and reverse direction.
# Add some more robust checks to validate against nonmanifold geometry like more than 2 faces connected to 1 edge and such.
#    And--in appropriate places--tests like component.is_manifold, component.is_boundary, and (for edges only, I think) e.is_wire
# Replace remaining shortest_path_select use (bounded faces).
# Do some speed tests on some of these functions to measure performance.  There's always a push/pull between the speed of C when using native Blender operators, the extra overhead of doing real selections and mode switches, and using python bmesh without doing real selections or mode switches.
# Implement deselection for all methods of selection (except maybe select_linked).
#    This is actually going to be problematic because we need to track the most recent DEselected component, which Blender does not do.
#    This addon only executes on double click.  We would have to build a helper function using the @persistent decorator to maintain a deselection list (even if said list is only 2 members long).
#    And we would have to replace the regular view3d.select operator in at least 1 place (whatever the keymap is for deselecting; e.g. Ctrl+Click.. or Shift+Click if it's set to Toggle?)
#    And Blender's wonky Undo system would invalidate the deselection list although that MAY not be a problem for something as simple as tracking only 2 components.
# Find out if these selection tools can be made to work in the UV Editor.
# Something is not working right if you're working on more than one object at a time in edit mode.  It will deselect components on anything but the most recent object you were working on.
#    I checked the original version of the script and this has apparently always been the case and I just didn't notice.  So that's something to investigate now; how to retain selection across multiple objects in edit mode.
#    If I had to guess this is probably because of all the instances where the script runs select_face, select_edge, and select_vert where it deselects everything, and probably also the times where we switch selection modes (vert, edge, face), and also because we're not getting a selection to restore per object.
#    So if we could get everything done with bmesh without doing real selections I *think* we could just add to existing selection which wouldn't clear selections and hopefully then we wouldn't even need to get a list of selected components to restore at all, much less per object.
# Write own loop/ring selection function for wire edges.  Loops will be easy because I don't think we have to worry about normal vector direction?  Rings will be harder because there's no face loop?  Or maybe it's the same with loop radial and then walk forward twice.  We'll see.
# Bounded edge loop selection on a floating edge ring like the Circle primitive type. (Wire edges.)
# Bounded edge loop selection on a mesh's boundary edges. (This is gonna be harder? Need a Loopanar-like solution that can measure gaps.)
#    Note: Interestingly Maya doesn't do bounded vertex loop selection on a boundary loop.  It does a select_linked instead.
# Select linked for vertices?  Maya has this if you double click a vertex or shift+double click a vert that is outside of a vertex loop (same as select_linked for faces, basically).  However, do. I. care?  Do people actually do select_linked with vertices?
# Possible new user preferences:
#    Terminate self-intersecting loops and rings at crossing point.
#        Successfully implemented this for face loops!  (The hardest part will be retrofitting this onto Loopanar for edge loops and rings.)
#        Self-intersects can happen with vertex loops, face loops, edge loops, edge rings, boundary edge loops (although boundary loops would need terrible topology it is still possible), and wire edge loops
#    Perhaps an "Experimental" preference for getting bounded loops off of triangles and n-gons.  Warn that this is slower than quads because we need to test more than 1 or 2 loops (up to N loops.. maybe with a restriction for absurdly large n-gons).  Use a While loop to walk every edge and break early if match found.
#    Allow user to specify which select_linked method they want to use on double click? (from a dropdown list)  Or, instead maybe forcibly pop up the delimit=set() in the corner instead?  Hmm but it doesn't appear to always force the popup?
#    A method and user preference to allow non-manifold edge loop selection?  e.g. a way to select an entire non-manifold loop of edges where an edge loop extrusion has been done in the middle of a grid; should be easy to code, it's the same as the boundary edge code except we ONLY want non-manifold edges.
# Loopanar code could possibly be improved with strategic use of more sets instead of lists in a few places.  I got the two main functions returning sets of indices as their final return but entire_loop and entire_ring might benefit from sets and/or returning indices. (former is probably easier than latter)
#    Loopanar is already very speedy, though, so I don't know how much this may improve it.  But I am doing membership checks outside of Loopanar with lists returned from Loopanar so this would speed that up.

        #And once we have the proper direction use the OTHER two edges from each original face to make the Loopanar ring selection.
        #Ugh, even that will run into a problem with faces that have loops that go back onto themselves (see Loop_Test_object.obj in my Documents\maya\projects\default\scenes folder).
        #Unless.. okay there may be a fix for that... if.. only 2 edges on each each face have a loop in common and neither of those edges share a vertex, we're golden.  Just select and use the OTHER two edges for our ring.
        #If each face has 3 shared loop edges in common then the one edge that shares a vertex with the other 2 edges is actually the one we can use to do our ring since it's effectively the same thing as step 2 above.
        #If each face has all 4 edges sharing a loop with all 4 edges of the other face then maybe we can try doing multiple ring selections, convert to vert, convert back to face, then count the length of each ring to face conversion and pick the shortest one as our bounded selection.

    # Probably need to use sets for comparison.

# Actually I thought of a better way to get a face loop for testing bounded selection that doesn't require a separate function to get a ring from 2 faces and then get faces from the ring.
# We also don't need to test 4 times.  Only 2, at most, and if the first test returns true we can skip doing the second test which means better performance!  (Note: Unless ugly edge cases happen; I'm designing for happy path first and then edge cases can be dealt with.)
# 1. Use the simple loop ring traversal method starting from a_edge1 (using code that can 'going_forward' and then go backward if reaching a dead end).
# 2. Every time we jump to the next loop, see if the loop.face is the previous_active_face. (Maybe also maintain a list of loops already visited similar to def walk_boundary here: https://github.com/BenjaminSauder/EdgeFlow/blob/master/util.py so that we don't waste time testing places we've checked already.)
# 3. If we reach the end and get no match, do it again using a_edge2.
# 4. If we get no match for either test, run faces_select_linked_flat back in the main class because it's not a bounded face.
# 5. If we do get a match, though, then we know which loop of faces is the correct direction.  Now we begin the work of determining the shortest number of faces between the active_face and previous_active_face (like whatever Loopanar is doing to determine gaps in group_unselected).
# 6. There might be a clever way to reduce the work for this step.  Instead of starting over from scratch now that we know which edge/loop corresponds to the proper direction..
#    We actually started building a list of faces back during the While Loop in step 2.
#    If we reach the previous_active_face on the first try (while going_forward), either because it's the correct direction or because the loop is infinite, then we already have one of our 'gaps' in a list of faces already (or whatever group_unselected is doing).
#    If we reach a dead end and have to reverse direction I'm not sure if we need to discard the list and start over in the other direction or if the built list is still useful later for the gap stuff ("these faces are definitely useless") and we should keep it while starting a second list.
#    Keeping it in a list of lists is probably the better idea.  Each list is a 'fragment'
#    If we have to continue to step 3. then the list(s) do have to be discarded and started over.
# 7. So we keep the list(s) from step 2 or 3 and now we do whatever the gaps stuff in group_unselected is and build another list of faces in the opposite direction and then do the comparison or whatever to determine which is shorter.  
#    I haven't closely inspected what group_unselected does and how the 'gaps' stuff works.
# 8. Return the correct faces for selection.
# 
# Additional idea: During the building of the loop, test to see if previous_active_face is the next_face (next_loop.face).  If true then in theory we can break?
