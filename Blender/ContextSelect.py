# ToDo: 
# Write own select_linked function. :(  We must do so if we want to get rid of all uses of real deselection.  Say one object mesh has multiple detached pieces, each with only a partial selection, and we want to select_linked for only ONE of the pieces.
#     Blender's select_linked will run on ALL of the pieces that have a partial selection, not purely on the active component.
# Fully implement checks for hidden geometry and prefs.ignore_hidden_geometry option. (Still need to test with instanced geometry.)
#     And then tell this guy about it: https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/ltbbbc/
# Add some more robust checks to validate against nonmanifold geometry like more than 2 faces connected to 1 edge and such.
#    And--in appropriate places--tests like component.is_manifold, component.is_boundary, and (for edges only, I think) e.is_wire
# Do some speed tests on some of these functions to measure performance.  There's always a push/pull between the speed of C when using native Blender operators, the extra overhead of doing real selections and mode switches, and using python bmesh without doing real selections or mode switches.
# Implement deselection for all methods of selection (except maybe select_linked).
#    This is actually going to be problematic because we need to track the most recent DEselected component, which Blender does not do.
#    This addon only executes on double click.  We would have to build a helper function using the @persistent decorator to maintain a deselection list (even if said list is only 2 members long).
#    And we would have to replace the regular view3d.select operator in at least 1 place (whatever the keymap is for deselecting; e.g. Ctrl+Click.. or Shift+Click if it's set to Toggle?)
#    And Blender's wonky Undo system would invalidate the deselection list although that MAY not be a problem for something as simple as tracking only 2 components.
# Find out if these selection tools can be made to work in the UV Editor. (NOTE: Probably need to set double click and shift double click operators for the UV section if the key map editor)
# Something is not working right if you're working on more than one object at a time in edit mode.  It will deselect components on all objects that aren't the most recent object you were working on.
#    I checked the original version of the script and this has apparently always been the case and I just didn't notice.  So that's something to investigate now; how to retain selection across multiple objects in edit mode.
#    If I had to guess this is probably because of all the instances where the script runs select_face, select_edge, and select_vert where it deselects everything, and probably also the times where we switch selection modes (vert, edge, face), and also because we're not getting a selection to restore per object.
#    So if we could get everything done with bmesh without doing real selections I *think* we could just add to existing selection which wouldn't clear selections and hopefully then we wouldn't even need to get a list of selected components to restore at all, much less per object.
# Write own loop/ring selection function for wire edges.  Loops will be easy because I don't think we have to worry about normal vector direction?  Rings will be harder because there's no face loop?  Or maybe it's the same with loop radial and then walk forward twice.  We'll see.
#    After looking into this, this is actually much harder than I thought it would be.  Rings might be impossible, loops are HARD unless it's just a single loop (only 2 edges per vertex like the Circle object).  Will need extra steps and 2 or 3-level deep testing.
# Bounded edge loop selection on a floating edge ring like the Circle primitive type. (Wire edges.)
# Bounded edge loop selection on a mesh's boundary edges. (This is gonna be harder? Need a Loopanar-like solution that can measure gaps.)
#    Note: Interestingly Maya doesn't do bounded vertex loop selection on a boundary loop.  It does a select_linked instead.
# Possible new user preferences:
#    Terminate self-intersecting loops and rings at crossing point.
#        Successfully implemented this for face loops and bounded vertices!  (The hardest part will be retrofitting this onto Loopanar for edge loops and rings.)
#        Self-intersects can happen with vertex loops, face loops, edge loops, edge rings, boundary edge loops (although boundary loops would need terrible topology it is still possible), and wire edge loops
#        Self-intersect at a boundary edge could be a +-shaped cross like extruding edges straight up from a grid, or it could be like deleting two diagonal quads in a grid so that 1 vert is shared by 2 diagonals but all 4 edges are boundary.
#    Allow user to specify which select_linked method they want to use on double click? (from a dropdown list)  Or, instead maybe forcibly pop up the delimit=set() in the corner instead?  Hmm but it doesn't appear to always force the popup?
#    A method and user preference to allow non-manifold edge loop selection?  e.g. a way to select an entire non-manifold loop of edges where an edge loop extrusion has been done in the middle of a grid; should be easy to code, it's the same as the boundary edge code except we ONLY want non-manifold edges.
#    Preference to not use bm.select_flush_mode() at the end of the functions? This would make it sort of more like Maya but in order to make it truly like Maya you'd have to replace all the regular view3d.select operators as well.
# Consolidate redundant code.  I still haven't figured out a proper way to do this since the main loop-getting functions are almost identical but with different methods for getting the next component and testing for dead ends...
# Investigate adding keymap entries automatically in the add-on preferences and/or the main keymap preferences.  What I know for certain is that the way Cirno's Box Select X-Ray add-on seems extraordinarily complicated and straight up does not work when I try to use his add-on (I always have to hard-code my defaults).
# Investigate doing our own raycasting. 
#    This would be needed if we want DEselection because Blender has no 'deselection history' list. Unless we want to compare the selection history for every view3d.select click but that would be much messier.
#    It is also a solution for the bug where double clicking on empty space causes a selection (although that one could alternatively be solved by adding 'deselect on nothing' to the default view3d.select keymap entries).
# Loopanar code could possibly be improved with strategic use of more sets instead of lists in a few places.  I got the two main functions returning sets of indices as their final return but entire_loop and entire_ring might benefit from sets and/or returning indices. (former is probably easier than latter)
#    Loopanar is already very speedy, though, so I don't know how much this may improve it.  But I am doing membership checks outside of Loopanar with lists returned from Loopanar so this would speed that up.
# Extension methods: manifold vertex, boundary vertex, wire vertex, nonmanifold vertex if I'm feeling spicy || manifold edge loop, manifold edge ring, boundary edge loop, wire edge loop, nonmanifold edge loop if I'm feeling spicy || face loop
#    Note, however, that the vertex extensions are basically the same thing as the edge loop extensions.
