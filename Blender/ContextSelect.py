# ToDo: 
# Find out if there need to be any tests for hidden or instanced geometry when we're doing selections.
#    A quick test with the face loop and boundary loop selection near hidden faces didn't seem to show any issues.
# Replace remaining shortest_path_select use (bounded faces).
# Do some speed tests on some of these functions to measure performance.  There's always a push/pull between the speed of C when using native Blender operators, the extra overhead of doing real selections and mode switches, and using python bmesh without doing real selections or mode switches.
# Implement deselection for all methods of selection (except maybe select_linked).
#    This is actually going to be problematic because we need to track the most recent DEselected component, which Blender does not do.
#    This addon only executes on double click.  We would have to build a helper function using the @persistent decorator to maintain a deselection list (even if said list is only 2 members long).
#    And we would have to replace the regular view3d.select operator in at least 1 place (whatever the keymap is for deselecting; e.g. Ctrl+Click.. or Shift+Click if it's set to Toggle?)
#    And Blender's wonky Undo system would invalidate the deselection list although that MAY not be a problem for something as simple as tracking only 2 components.
# Find out if these selection tools can be made to work in the UV Editor.
# See if it would be feasible to implement this idea as an optional addon preference: https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/ltbbbc/
# Something is not working right if you're working on more than one object at a time in edit mode.  It will deselect components on anything but the most recent object you were working on.
#    I checked the original version of the script and this has apparently always been the case and I just didn't notice.  So that's something to investigate now; how to retain selection across multiple objects in edit mode.
#    If I had to guess this is probably because of all the instances where the script runs select_face, select_edge, and select_vert where it deselects everything, and probably also the times where we switch selection modes (vert, edge, face), and also because we're not getting a selection to restore per object.
#    So if we could get everything done with bmesh without doing real selections I *think* we could just add to existing selection which wouldn't clear selections and hopefully then we wouldn't even need to get a list of selected components to restore at all, much less per object.

    # Probably need to use sets for comparison.

# Actually I thought of a better way to get a face loop for testing bounded selection that doesn't require a separate function to get a ring from 2 faces and then get faces from the ring.
# We also don't need to test 4 times.  Only 2, at most, and if the first test returns true we can skip doing the second test which means better performance!  (Note: Unless ugly edge cases happen; I'm designing for happy path first and then edge cases can be dealt with.)
# 1. Use the simple loop ring traversal method starting from a_edge1 (using code that can 'going_forward' and then go backward if reaching a dead end).
# 2. Every time we jump to the next loop, see if the loop.face is the previous_active_face. (Maybe also maintain a list of loops already visited similar to def walk_boundary here: https://github.com/BenjaminSauder/EdgeFlow/blob/master/util.py so that we don't waste time testing places we've checked already.)
# 3. If we reach the end and get no match, do it again using a_edge2.
# 4. If we get no match for either test, run faces_select_linked_flat back in the main class because it's not a bounded face.
# 5. If we do get a match, though, then we know which loop of faces is the correct direction.  Now we begin the work of determining the shortest number of faces between the active_face and previous_active_face (like whatever Loopanar is doing to determine gaps in group_unselected).
# 6. There might be a clever way to reduce the work for this step.  Instead of starting over from scratch now that we know which edge/loop corresponds to the proper direction..
#    We actually started building a list of faces back during the While Loop in step 2.
#    If we reach the previous_active_face on the first try (while going_forward), either because it's the correct direction or because the loop is infinite, then we already have one of our 'gaps' in a list of faces already (or whatever group_unselected is doing).
#    If we reach a dead end and have to reverse direction I'm not sure if we need to discard the list and start over in the other direction or if the built list is still useful later for the gap stuff ("these faces are definitely useless") and we should keep it while starting a second list.
#    Keeping it in a list of lists is probably the better idea.  Each list is a 'fragment'
#    If we have to continue to step 3. then the list(s) do have to be discarded and started over.
# 7. So we keep the list(s) from step 2 or 3 and now we do whatever the gaps stuff in group_unselected is and build another list of faces in the opposite direction and then do the comparison or whatever to determine which is shorter.  
#    I haven't closely inspected what group_unselected does and how the 'gaps' stuff works.
# 8. Return the correct faces for selection.
# 
# Additional idea: During the building of the loop, test to see if previous_active_face is the next_face (next_loop.face).  If true then in theory we can break?
