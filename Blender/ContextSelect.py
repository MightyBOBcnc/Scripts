# ToDo: 
# Fully implement checks for hidden geometry and prefs.ignore_hidden_geometry option. (Still need to test with instanced geometry.)
#     And then tell this guy about it: https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/ltbbbc/
# Add some more robust checks to validate against nonmanifold geometry like more than 2 faces connected to 1 edge and such.
#    And--in appropriate places--tests like component.is_manifold, component.is_boundary, and (for edges only, I think) e.is_wire
# More speed/performance testing and improvements.
# Implement deselection for all methods of selection (except maybe select_linked).
#    This is actually going to be problematic because we need to track the most recent DEselected component, which Blender does not do.
#    This addon only executes on double click.  We would have to build a helper function using the @persistent decorator to maintain a deselection list (even if said list is only 2 members long).
#    And we would have to replace the regular view3d.select operator in at least 1 place (whatever the keymap is for deselecting; e.g. Ctrl+Click.. or Shift+Click if it's set to Toggle?)
#    And Blender's wonky Undo system would invalidate the deselection list although that MAY not be a problem for something as simple as tracking only 2 components.
#        Rather than using an object property to store the two most recently deselected components would it make sense to use a custom layer?
#        https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/assigning-custom-properties-to-vertexes/  (Probably not; but it's worth investigating the performance costs involved in creating, updating, or deleting custom layers.  I still have to do my own raycasts either way..)
# Investigate doing our own raycasting. 
#    This would be needed if we want DEselection because Blender has no 'deselection history' list. Unless we want to compare the selection history for every view3d.select click but that would be much messier.
#    It is also a solution for the bug where double clicking on empty space causes a selection (although that one could alternatively be solved by adding 'deselect on nothing' to the default view3d.select keymap entries).
# Find out if these selection tools can be made to work in the UV Editor. (NOTE: Probably need to set double click and shift double click operators for the UV section if the key map editor)
# Write own loop/ring selection function for wire edges.  Loops will be easy because I don't think we have to worry about normal vector direction?  Rings will be harder because there's no face loop?  Or maybe it's the same with loop radial and then walk forward twice.  We'll see.
#    After looking into this, this is actually much harder than I thought it would be.  Rings might be impossible, loops are HARD unless it's just a single loop (only 2 edges per vertex like the Circle object).  Will need extra steps and 2 or 3-level deep testing.
# Bounded edge loop selection on a floating edge ring like the Circle primitive type. (Wire edges.)
# Possible new user preferences:
#    Terminate self-intersecting loops and rings at crossing point.
#        Successfully implemented this for all manifold component selections and boundary edges! That just leaves nonmanifold selection types if I choose to do so.
#    Allow user to specify which select_linked method they want to use on double click? (from a dropdown list)  Or, instead maybe forcibly pop up the delimit=set() in the corner instead?  Hmm but it doesn't appear to always force the popup?
#    Preference to not use bm.select_flush_mode() at the end of the functions? This would make it so that sub-components aren't visibly selected (e.g. the edge between 2 verts) but you'd have to replace all the regular view3d.select operators as well.
# Consolidate redundant code.  I still haven't figured out a proper way to do this since the main loop-getting functions are almost identical but with different methods for getting the next component and testing for dead ends...
#    Partially done, now.  Made generic partial loop functions for manifold vertices, edges, and faces that are strung together to get full loops or bounded loops.
# Investigate if bm.free() is needed to prevent memory leaks.  (Free the bmesh) According to the bmesh documentation this happens automatically when a script ends but there are a couple spots where I think I'm getting multiple bmeshes so it might be wise to free them up separately.
# Investigate adding keymap entries automatically in the add-on preferences and/or the main keymap preferences.  What I know for certain is that the way Cirno's Box Select X-Ray add-on seems extraordinarily complicated and straight up does not work when I try to use his add-on (I always have to hard-code my defaults).
# Extension methods: 
#    [X] manifold vertex, 
#        [X] Full loop
#        [X] Bounded loop
#    [ ] boundary vertex, 
#        [p] Full loop (for the time being this works by using the edge mode)
#        [ ] Bounded loop
#    [ ] wire vertex, 
#        [ ] Full loop
#        [ ] Bounded loop
#    [ ] nonmanifold vertex if I'm feeling spicy
#        [ ] Full loop
#        [ ] Bounded loop
#    [X] manifold edge loop, 
#        [X] Full loop
#        [X] Bounded loop
#    [X] manifold edge ring, 
#        [X] Full loop
#        [X] Bounded loop
#    [X] boundary edge loop, 
#        [X] Full loop
#        [X] Bounded loop
#    [ ] wire edge loop, 
#        [ ] Full loop
#        [ ] Bounded loop
#    [ ] nonmanifold edge loop if I'm feeling spicy
#        [ ] Full loop
#        [ ] Bounded loop
#    [X] face loop
#        [X] Full loop
#        [X] Bounded loop
# 
# Fix the boundary edge partial loop function to return indices?  How about we performance test the different between getting and selecting indices and components.  If there's no performance difference we should just use components directly. Other future use cases may need them.
# 
# For vertices and faces.. to stop them from running twice on a bounded loop that is infinite we could do like..
# if "infinite" in list:
    # for face in the connected faces:
        # if that face index in list:
            # remove that connecting face edge loop from consideration so we don't run again in the opposite direction..
